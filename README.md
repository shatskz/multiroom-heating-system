CS 6376 - Foundations of Hybrid and Embedded Systems - Final Project

Created with MATLAB/Simulink (Version R2022a Update 4 (MATLAB 9.12)) on a Mac (x86 processor)

To simulate system: 
1) Open the file in Simulink
2) Navigate to the Heater Controller subsystem component block
3) Double click on the scope block
4) Click the run button at the top of the scope window that opens up
5) View plots (it may be easier to view the results in 3 separate plots by going to View > Layout in the scope window)
